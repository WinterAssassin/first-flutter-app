# first-flutter-app
My first code along app based on flutter tutorials. This is a simple namer app. It shows a combination of words where users can hit the like button to save their favorites and hit the next button to
generate next combination of words. A history of words is animated at top of the generated words where users can scroll that part and save and unsave previous words.
